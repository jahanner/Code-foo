<h1>Empire State Building with Lincoln Logs</h1>
</body>
<p> '''I first started out this assignment by looking for as many detailed building dimensions for the Empire State Building as I could. It turned out to take longer than I had hoped and I still was only able to find relatively obscure architechtural blueprints. </p>

<p>Using the assortment of Lincoln Log sizes, I approximate I can use 128 logs to make a square foot.
The total floor area in square feet of the Empire State Building minus the ground floor is 2,684,701. Which would mean I need 343,641,728 Lincoln Logs for the total floor area assuming the floors are one foot thick. It's 1252 ft. high and 187 ft. wide according to this<a href='http://www.nyc-architecture.com/MID/MID073.htm'>website<a/> giving each side an approximate area of 233,750 sq ft. Therefore, I would need 119,680,000 Lincoln Logs assuming the walls are one foot thick. A rough estimate of the number of logs needed would then be 463,321,728.
